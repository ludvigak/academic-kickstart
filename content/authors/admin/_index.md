I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [SFU math department](http://math.sfu.ca),
as part of a fellowship from the [Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation's program for
mathematics](https://kaw.wallenberg.org/en/ludvig-af-klinteberg).

My background is in numerical analysis, with a mix of fluid mechanics,
physics, and computer science. Most of my current work is focused on
developing fast, high-order integral equation methods, for simulations
of flows governed by the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations.
